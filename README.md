# RealityKitSideBySideRenderExample

This project demostrates show to use RealityKit to render side by side 3D video on visionOS. It contains how to use `TextureResource.DrawableQueue` and `ShaderGraphMaterial`.

You'll need to supply your own side by side video file for this project to build. I used [this video](https://vimeo.com/167717612) for testing.
